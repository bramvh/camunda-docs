If your cluster is paused, you can resume it at any time.

To resume your paused cluster:

1. Navigate to **Console**, and select the **Clusters** tab.
1. The cluster **Status** shows “Paused” if a cluster is paused. Select the cluster that you want to resume.
1. On the cluster **Overview** tab, select **Resume cluster** in the **Status** row of the **Cluster Details**. The cluster resumes running, which typically takes five to ten minutes to complete.
